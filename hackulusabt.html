      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Objective- To help women in underprivileged or backward communities get better access to healthcare and sanitation with primary focus on the availability of sanitary pads. Implementation- The problem will be solved by the creation of a system of memberships, supply chains, communities and quality, yet cheap, production of pads. In India, there are still hundreds and thousands of places where women do not get access to sanitary pads or hygienic conditions, as a result of which lakhs of women still UTIs, bacterial infections and even deaths. In order to solve this problem, the issue of lack of accessibility and availability of pads must be addressed. This however brings up another problem that prevents women in many areas and societies from being safe, the issue of periods being a taboo. Periods is something isn’t talked about in most families and societies as it is considered something indecent, as something to hide. if only there was enough awareness about the issue, most families and societies would themselves look out for the women of their family and their sanitation. Our program will also face this issue of awareness as a secondary objective. The project will work as a monthly membership where women from all areas will be able to register, or deregister, to a monthly delivery of a couple of sanitary pads. This delivery will be dated depending on each woman’s cycle. The woman will have to enter the tentative dates for the beginning of her periods at the time of registration, after which she will be sent a sanitary kit every 3weeks. The service will also be available to women of a society as a whole where sanitary kits will be sent in bulk. The women of the society can then use and take the kits according to their needs. In this model too, the kits will be sent to the society every month. The number of kits sent will be dependent on the number of women in the society. The women will be able to register to the service through almost every platform available. Through apps, websites, or even through a simple SMS or call. After adequate publicity, we aim to make the service available to every woman no matter where she is or in what condition. By getting basic data such as the address, the cycle dates and age, through any platform available, women everywhere will be able to make use of this membership program. The pricing of the membership will be kept lower than the pads available in the market to allow more women, even those below the poverty line to get access to basic sanitation. For societies or families who still won’t be able to afford this service, the membership will be given free after a proof of economic background is given. To promote awareness about the issue and to get more women to form societies to help themselves, the pricing of society memberships will be kept significantly lower than individual memberships. Through this we hope to show the undereducated societies how investing in sanitation and healthcare is a lot cheaper than paying hospitals for treatments and significantly less of a burden than that of letting the women of the family die of disease. For the backend working of the membership program, we will need a database to store the data of every woman and society that registers. The backend data will be fed to a system of automation that will combine and sort the data into dates and number of kits that need to be sent. Then through partner manufacturers and delivery service providers, the kits will be dispatched straight from the factory or warehouse of the manufacturer to reduce the cost of having a middle man. This will significantly reduce the time and money needed to make sanitary kits available to women all over the country. A data allocation system will sort the members into states and districts in order to connect them to the nearest factory or warehouse. This way too, will reduce delivery time and charges. Application- This idea would allow women all around the country to get access to free and quality sanitation and healthcare. we aim to expand services to other healthcare products later.</p>
